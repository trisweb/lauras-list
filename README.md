Laura's List
============

A simple restaurant list - for those &quot;where should we go to eat?&quot; moments.

The Idea
--------

Ever have those moments? "I know so many restaurants around town, and I keep hearing about new ones, but I can't think of them when I actually want to go out to eat and always end up at the same place!" Well I've had lots of those moments. Living in a big city with tons of restaurants, it's a shame that I keep eating at the same ones. Yelp has become useless (oh look, it's rated 3.5 stars, how *helpful*) and Foursquare is just a competition.

What I really wanted was a simple list of restaurants. Put 'em on a map, tag them with useful information, and give me full control over what restuarants are listed. Will it take more work? A little, sure. But I'd rather write down 10 restaurants that I discovered and actually want to try, than have to wade through 100 restaurants with absolutely no clue which one of them is worth my time, and no good way to keep track.

On top of that, I want it to be flexible. Almost as flexible as paper. Screw ratings. I trust you can remember what food tastes like. If you really want ratings, tag them with shit you'll remember. For example "tasty" or "awesome-drinks" or "gluten-free" or "food-poisoning-dont-return." Alternatively, if you don't like a restaurant, just remove it from your list, or mark it "archived." No one's forcing you to look at stuff you don't want to see.

Want to share with friends? Send them a fucking link. This is a web site, not a "social media app." Maybe later I'll let you share lists or something, I don't know.

Core concepts:
--------------

* Restaurants. A list of them.
* Tags on restaurants.
* A map thingy.
